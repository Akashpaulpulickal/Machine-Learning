We can split the data types into three main categories:

Numerical
Categorical
Ordinal
Numerical data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories:

Discrete Data
- counted data that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.
Continuous Data
- measured data that can be any number. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item
Categorical data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.

Ordinal data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.




In Machine Learning (and in mathematics) there are often three values that interests us:

Mean - The average value
Median - The mid point value
Mode - The most common value

speed of cars   = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

mean
The mean value is the average value.
mean = (99+86+87+88+111+86+103+87+94+78+77+85+86) / 13 = 89.77

median 
The median value is the value in the middle, after you have sorted all the values
77, 78, 85, 86, 86, 86, 87, 87, 88, 94, 99, 103, 111

mode
The Mode value is the value that appears the most number of times
99, 86, 87, 88, 111, 86, 103, 87, 94, 78, 77, 85, 86 = 86


Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.

A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.

A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.

Example: This time we have registered the speed of 7 cars:
speed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86]
The standard deviation is:0.9
